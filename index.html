    <h2>seven wonders</h2>
    <p>The Seven Wonders of the World are amazing places that are famous around the globe. These include the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Great Wall of China, and the Taj Mahal. They are special because they show how clever and skilled people can be. I would love to visit the Taj Mahal because it looks like a palace from a fairy tale. When people visit these wonders, they take care of them by not leaving trash and by being quiet and respectful. This helps keep the wonders beautiful for everyone to enjoy.</p>
